# snrkyAPI
A nodejs api that uses snarksjs for authentication

so I was reading this https://scholar.dsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1426&context=theses

and thought it was too complicated for my small brain so I decided to do something with it in the hope of understanding what is going on.

And got something out of it,  a nodejs API that uses zero knowledge verification in the server, the client is expected to send the verification key in a JSON body... for now.
